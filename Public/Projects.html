    <h1>My Projects</h1>
    <p>Recently I started learning full stack development. Here are some of the projects I have worked on:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h3>Only HTML coding</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="https://vinczesz11.github.io/html_portfolio/">Little Portfolio Page</a></li>
                <p>This is a compliation of my skills learnt during my first lessons.</p>
                <li><a href="https://vinczesz11.github.io/html_portfolio2/">Napoli Informations</a></li>
                <p>This is a page about the city of Naples, Italy, which I visited during my Erasmus semester. I created this website as practice after finishing my first ever modul in learning web development.
                    <p>The page is written in Hungarian.</p>
        
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ul>
